      <h3 className="text-lg">About Me</h3>
      This page was written by Sebastian Laskowski. I want to become a Front Web
      Developer and in the future a Full Stack Developer. Here you will find a
      collection of applications that I wrote during the learning process. I am
      a graduate of the Technical School of Computer Science, currently studying
      Automation and Robotics at Kielce University of Technology, and working as
      a PLC and C programmer. In the meantime, I am learning web programming
      including HTML, Sass and JavaScript. I have completed an advanced CSS and
      Sass course (LINK), and am in the middle of a JavaScript course (LINK).
      Currently, the most developed application by me is Mapty. I have learned
      how to use Classes (ES6+), prototypes, array manipulation, I am also
      learning React technology, and in the future I want to develop skills
      related to writing Backend.
